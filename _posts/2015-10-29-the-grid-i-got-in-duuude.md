# The Grid - I Got In Duuude!

It has finally happened. After over a year of waiting, I finally got a chance to witness the prowess of The Grid. Let's see if it is all that it claims to be. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aa7812ae-e65f-426f-a447-f3bf2f778e18.PNG)

There is no question in my mind that this has the potential to be the new wave of website building. People are more and more driven towards things that are automated, efficient, and easy. Website building has always been one of those tricky elements of life. Everyone seems to need one, yet all solutions either require tremendous skill or are so vanilla that you will get laughed at. Ironically though, people expect the same quality of website from a total amateur as they do from Google. 

This is the exact gap brains behind The Grid aim to solve. What if there was a way for websites to build themselves? Just in time for Back to the Future Day (October 21, 2015), that future became a reality for me.
